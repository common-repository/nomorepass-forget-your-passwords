Use your mobile phone to login into wordpress. Allow users instant registration. Fully protection against force brute attacks

== Description ==
<strong>NoMorePass</strong> is a secure and easy to use technology to provide you two factor autentication on every situation. This plugin allows you to login to wordpress using just your mobile phone, with no other requirement. No registering, no API keys, install, activate and that's all.
Your passwords will be <strong>only on your mobile phone</strong>, no copies over your computers, not even on nomorepass servers, fully anonymous. Login just scanning a one-time qr-code.

* <strong>Safe</strong> Your passwords are encrypted all the time, all transfers are on https and the credentials are encrypted with single-use keys.
* <strong>Personal</strong> Your passwords always go with you. No servers, no insecure transfers, no browser dependencies. Fully anonymous.
* <strong>Easy</strong> Magic! You can send passwords to your favorite websites without any effort. Just scan a qr-code with the app.

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Install the app in your phone:

* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.biblioeteca.apps.NoMorePass) Android.
* [Apple Appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/no-more-pass/id1199780162) iOS 

<strong>Instant user registration</strong>
You have a new configuration option named "Auto-login after registration" that allows your users scan the provided qr-code only providing username and email, then the password is sent to the mobile phone and the user is registered immediately.
Register your users in just one step, safely.

== Configuration ==

In the admin page you have 5 different options:

1. Show login form : shows or hide the user and password fields. If hidden only using QR is possible login.
1. Show password reset : shows or hide the password field when resetting password. If hidden the password is sent to the mobile phone using QR directly.
1. Auto-launch QR : makes the NoMorePass QR be launched when login page loads.
1. Auto-login : if you select this option the user will login directly after the registration without email verification. Use with caution, this option will reduce the registration dramatically (just 1 step) but the emails are not verified (but you know people registered have used nomorepass, so they are humans).
1. Only Nomorepass : allows logins only using nomorepass app
1. Custom Logo: allows to upload a new icon for login
1. Custom Message: allows to change the login message
